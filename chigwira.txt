<p>I want to be able to write software at the end of this semester. I also want to learn new things about software that I do not currently know, like what languages are easy to use to write software. This semester, there are some classes that I am taking because I have to take them or to bring up my credits to full time. This class will help me decide what I want to do with my computer science major after graduation. In some other classes I see success as getting passing grades but in this class success expanding my knowledge and helping decide what I want to do in the future. </p>
